# Background

I was not familiar with Web development, but I decided to create a portfolio site using a relatively new technology stack because I thought it was the minimum skill to be an engineer.

# Technology Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Vercel Storage

I mainly implemented it using these technologies.

## Reason for selection
I wanted to use SSR or SSG because it is a portfolio site and a blog site. Currently, NextJS and NuxtJS are the two giants, and I had experience with both, but I preferred NextJS and adopted it considering the future of .tsx notation. In addition, it was easy to host on Vercel, the development supervisor, and Vercel Storage could be used, so NextJS was promoted.
