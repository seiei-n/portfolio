# Background

I was not familiar with Web development, but I decided to create a portfolio site using a relatively new technology stack because I thought it was the minimum skill to be an engineer.

# Technology Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Vercel Storage

I mainly implemented it using these technologies.

## Reason for selection

First of all, it is a portfolio and blog site, so I wanted to use a technology stack that is easy to maintain and has high performance.
